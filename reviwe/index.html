	<p>Web has grown a lot in the past 20 years. I’m being as specific as saying 20 years because I remember growing up learning different things about it. For me, I’ve been wanting to be a web designer since I was 10. My dream was built when I first started using computers and believe me when I say I remember working with Windows XP when it first came out. Internet and Web is the upcoming future. Unfortunately, I’d rate the web 5 out of 10 with 10 being excellent. Even though today internet is being used for a lot of great things, including education, businesses, careers, and a lot of other great things, but it started being a disaster lately as we have been noticing that even our school emails is been getting hacked by others. Of course schools are not the only organizations or spots that get that problem and hacking is a national problem, but my point of view is people started getting to educate themselves the wrong way about Web and Internet today to the point that they are happy to curse on others or send inappropriate content through others emails to their friends. Internet is the future, but I personally think that people must use it wisely and for the goods.</p>
